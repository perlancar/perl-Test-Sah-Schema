0.010   2021-07-20  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

0.009   2020-06-13  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Test examples with Perinci::Sub::Wrapper (PSW) if available, to test
	  that code generated by coercion rules/prefilter/etc behave correctly
	  when used in a wrapped subroutine, e.g. they do not use 'return' to
	  accidently exit early from the wrapper subroutine. PSW is used when we
	  use Perinci::Access::Perl, which in turn is used in applications like
	  Perinci::CmdLine.
